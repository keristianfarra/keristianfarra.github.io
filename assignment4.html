            <h2> Task </h2>
            <p>Create a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a transistor to control load power separate from logic power. You have to use analogWrite(), a high-load output device, and an input sensor.

               I used pin A0 for the LDR. The  LED strip is connected to Pin 9 through the transistor.

            <p>Above is the schematic for this circuit. It shows how each part is connected.</P>

            <p>
                Here is the calculations for the LED strip, the LDR and the current in the lED.The min. resistor value for LDR is  25 ohms. However, even with the LDR big amount of 5V would flow into the ground so I added a fixed 10k ohms resistor to further reduce the flow[avoid the risk of equipment damage].

            <p>
               Aboce is the code I wrote for the High(er) voltage and transistors.
            </p>
            <p>
               What It Does: Reads an analog input pin, maps the result to a range from 0 to 255 and uses
               the result to set the pulse width modulation (PWM) of an output pin. Also prints the results to the Serial Monitor.
            </p>
            <p>
               I chose sensor value range 400-620 for the green because when I checked the Serial Moniter the value gets bigger as my finger moves aways from the sensor/LDR. Therefore, when the sensor value is higher than 400, it will turns off the LED
            </p>
            <p>
               On the other hand, I choose values lesss than 350 for the sensor value because numbers were getting smaller as I get closer to the sensor.Therefore, when the sensor value is lower than 350, the LED will turn on.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
            The Circuit:
               <li> The photoresistor connected to analog input pin A0.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
            Read the comments on the code to understand how it works.
