               I used pin 2 for the pushbutton.The Green LED is connected to Pin 11. The Yellow LED is connected to Pin 9. The Red LED is connected to Pin 6. I have calcuated the resistance for each LED and then used 1kohms resistors for each LED to limit the current flowing through the LEDs.

               Above is the schematic for the three LEDs. Although the calcuation shows the resistor as 160 ohms, the closest was 330 which broke my LED so I resorted to using 1000 ohms resistor for each LED [Green, Yellow, and Red] with 5V power from the Arduino board. I also used 20mA as the target current and 1.8V for the drop voltage[the same for the Green, Yellow, and Red LED].
            </p>
            <p> Although the minimum resistance needed for the  Button is 250, I used 1k ohms because it was safer choice.

               Here is the code I wrote for the LEDs to fade. Read the comments on the code to understand how it works.
