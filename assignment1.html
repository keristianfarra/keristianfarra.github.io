            3 LEDs connected to the Arduino

            I began with writting the firmware (in a .ino file) for the circuit that makes the LEDs blink in a pattern. The pattern was for all three LED Lights to light at once then turn off in order: Green, Yellow, and then Red. I chose those colors in that order because they are my native country, Ethiopia flag. I then implmented a circuit for the 3 LEDs. I used 1K resistors for each LED to limit the current flowing through the LEDs.
