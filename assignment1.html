            I used pin 8, 10, and 12 pins for the 3 LEDs circuit. I programmed the in Arduino IDE to make the LEDs blink in a pattern. The pattern was for all three LED Lights to light at once then turn off in order: Green, Yellow, and then Red. I have calcuated the resistance for each LED and then used 1kohms resistors for each LED to limit the current flowing through the LEDs.

            Above is the schematic for the three LEDs. Based on the in-class blink activity, I used 1000 ohms resistor with 5V power from the Arduino board. I also used 20mA as the target and 1.8V for the drop voltage for the Green, Yellow, and Red LED.

           Here is the code I wrote for the LEDs to blink in a pattern. Read the comments on the code to understand how it works.
