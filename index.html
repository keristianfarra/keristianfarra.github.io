            My name is Keristian Farra! I'm senior in HCDE major focusing on HCI. I am excited to learn how to build working prototypes using the Arduino kit. I don't have any electrical or mechanical background so I believe this class would be a good introductory course for me. I have heard many good things about this class and now I am ready to experience it myself.
